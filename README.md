Protect your website by controlling the rel attributes of links, enforcing security best practices, and optimizing for SEO.

== Description ==

**LinkRel Defender** helps you manage external and internal links on your WordPress website. It allows you to control how links behave by setting them as **dofollow**, **nofollow**, and specifying if they should open in a **new tab** or **same window**.

This is particularly useful for **SEO**, **security**, and **user experience improvements**. The plugin automatically processes all links within your content and applies the appropriate attributes based on your settings.

### Key Features:

- **Define Internal Links**: Specify domains that should open in the same window.
- **Manage Dofollow Links**: Ensure specific domains remain **dofollow**.
- **Enforce Nofollow Links**: Automatically set specified domains to **nofollow**.
- **Open Nofollow Links in New Tab**: Optionally force all nofollow links to open in a new tab for security reasons.
- **Automatic Link Processing**: Modifies links dynamically without modifying your content.
- **SEO & Security Benefits**: Helps prevent malicious link issues and ensures your site follows best practices.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress.
3. Go to **Settings > LinkRel Defender** to configure the plugin.
